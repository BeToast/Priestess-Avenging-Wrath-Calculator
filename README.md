# Priestess-Avenging-Wrath-Calculator
Hearthstone Program to Calculate the odds of lethal using randomly distributed damage. Written in C language

This program works for any random repeating single target damage spell that can go face:
	Imprisoned Antaen
	Priestess of Fury
	Arcane Missiles
	Avenging Wrath
With the popularity of demon hunter the calculator is useful despite there only being a few standard cards this is applicable for.
